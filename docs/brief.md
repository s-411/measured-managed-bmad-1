# Project Brief: MM Health Tracker

## Executive Summary

MM Health Tracker is a comprehensive personal health and fitness management platform that combines BMR-based nutrition tracking, specialized gymnastics/mobility training, and productivity tools in a single integrated application. The system addresses the fragmentation of health data across multiple apps by providing a unified dashboard for tracking calories, macros, exercise, medical injections, deep work sessions, and specialized training progressions. Targeting health-conscious individuals who actively manage their fitness, nutrition, and medical protocols, the application delivers immediate value through real-time calorie balance calculations and sophisticated analytics that reveal correlations between health metrics and performance outcomes.

## Problem Statement

Health-conscious individuals currently juggle 5-10 different applications to manage their wellness journey - MyFitnessPal for calories, Strava for workouts, separate apps for medical tracking, productivity tools for goal setting, and specialized apps for niche training programs. This fragmentation creates several critical problems: data silos prevent users from seeing correlations between different health aspects, manual data entry across multiple apps leads to tracking fatigue and abandonment, lack of integrated analytics means missed insights about what actually drives results, and the cognitive overhead of managing multiple systems reduces adherence to health protocols. The market lacks a truly comprehensive solution that treats health holistically - combining nutrition, exercise, medical management, specialized training, and productivity in one cohesive system with sophisticated analytics to surface actionable insights.

## Proposed Solution

MM Health Tracker solves the fragmentation problem through an integrated health management platform built around a BMR-based calculation engine that provides real-time feedback on calorie balance throughout the day. The core innovation lies in the unified data model that enables cross-domain analytics - users can discover correlations between their deep work completion and calorie adherence, or between their gymnastics training frequency and weight trends. The application succeeds where others fail by: providing domain-specific features (like injectable compound management with ester calculations) that eliminate the need for specialized apps, implementing a sophisticated localStorage-based architecture that ensures instant responsiveness without server latency, and focusing on actionable insights rather than just data collection. The high-level vision positions MM Health Tracker as the single source of truth for personal health optimization.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: Health Optimization Enthusiasts

**Demographics:** Ages 25-45, predominantly male (70%), household income $75K+, college-educated professionals in tech, finance, and healthcare sectors.

**Current Behaviors:** Actively track calories and macros daily, follow structured workout programs, experiment with supplements and performance compounds, use multiple apps (5-8 on average) for different aspects of health, export data to spreadsheets for custom analysis.

**Specific Needs:** Unified tracking across all health dimensions, automated calculations for complex protocols (BMR, compound dosing), correlation analysis between different metrics, quick data entry without friction, evidence-based insights for optimization decisions.

**Goals:** Achieve and maintain target body composition, optimize performance in specific disciplines (strength, endurance, mobility), manage medical protocols safely and effectively, maximize productivity alongside health goals.

### Secondary User Segment: Medical Protocol Managers

**Demographics:** Individuals managing TRT, HRT, or other injectable protocols, ages 30-60, working with healthcare providers, require precise tracking for medical compliance.

**Current Workflows:** Manual logging in notebooks or basic apps, calculating dosages with online calculators, tracking injection sites on paper, preparing reports for healthcare visits.
