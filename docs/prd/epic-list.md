# Epic List

Based on the 14 major features and MVP scope, I recommend structuring the development into 4 focused epics that deliver incremental value:

- **Epic 1: Foundation & Core Health Tracking** - Establish project infrastructure, user profiles with BMR calculations, daily dashboard, and basic calorie/weight tracking
- **Epic 2: Exercise & Nutrition Management** - Complete exercise logging with MET calculations, macro tracking, food templates, and meal categorization
- **Epic 3: Specialized Features & Medical Tracking** - Injectable compound management, MIT planning, weekly objectives, and deep work tracking
- **Epic 4: Analytics & Advanced Training** - Nirvana Life training system, progress milestones, comprehensive analytics, and data export functionality
