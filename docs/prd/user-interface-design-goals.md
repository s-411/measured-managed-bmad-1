# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Create a dashboard-centric experience where users can see their complete health picture at a glance, with progressive disclosure for detailed tracking. The interface should feel like a personal health command center, combining the simplicity of consumer apps with the depth of professional tools. Every interaction should reinforce the connection between different health aspects through visual cues and intelligent data presentation.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Quick Entry Forms**: Modal-based data entry with smart defaults and recent items
- **Card-Based Layouts**: Consistent information hierarchy using the MM Design System cards
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Instant calculation updates as users enter data
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Summary views expand to detailed tracking interfaces
- **Cross-Domain Insights**: Visual indicators when correlations are detected
- **Gesture Support**: Swipe navigation between daily entries on mobile

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on responsive web design that adapts from mobile (320px) through desktop (4K). Progressive Web App capabilities for mobile users with offline support and home screen installation.
