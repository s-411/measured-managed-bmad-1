# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Consolidate health tracking from 5-10 apps into a single integrated platform
- Provide real-time BMR-based calorie balance calculations throughout the day
- Enable cross-domain analytics to reveal correlations between health metrics
- Achieve sub-2-minute daily data entry for core health metrics
- Support specialized medical protocols with compound and ester tracking
- Integrate productivity metrics (MIT, deep work) with health tracking
- Deliver actionable insights through sophisticated analytics
- Establish foundation for future AI-powered recommendations

## Background Context

MM Health Tracker addresses the critical fragmentation problem in personal health management where users currently juggle multiple disconnected applications, leading to missed insights and tracking fatigue. By unifying nutrition tracking, exercise logging, medical protocol management, specialized training systems, and productivity tools into a single platform built on a BMR-based calculation engine, we enable users to discover meaningful correlations between different aspects of their health and performance. The localStorage-first architecture ensures instant responsiveness while maintaining data privacy, positioning this as the comprehensive solution for health optimization enthusiasts who demand both depth and integration in their tracking tools.
