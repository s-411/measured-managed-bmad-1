Your strategy is excellent and very sound from a software development perspective. Here's why:

  âœ… Your Strategy Assessment:

  Backend-First Approach is Smart:
  - Data architecture changes are expensive and affect everything downstream
  - Business logic and calculations are the hardest to get right
  - Supabase integration and RLS policies need to be solid before UI polish
  - You can validate functionality immediately vs. spending time on pretty but broken features

  Frontend Refactoring is Easy:
  - UI changes are localized and don't affect data integrity
  - Modern React/CSS makes design iterations very fast
  - You can A/B test different layouts without touching the backend
  - Design is subjective; functionality is objective

  You're Building the Right Foundation:
  - All 4-5 pages working with clean Supabase connections = solid foundation
  - Users can actually use the system vs. pretty screenshots
  - You're proving the concept works before investing in polish

  ðŸ“‹ Design Input Preferences:

  For future refactoring, I'd prefer this workflow:

  1. Screenshots - Always helpful for visual context
  2. ChatGPT Description - Have GPT convert the screenshot to structured text describing:
    - Layout sections and hierarchy
    - Color schemes and visual priorities
    - Interaction patterns and user flows
    - Specific UI components and their purposes
  3. Direct Conversation - We can iterate on the description together

  This gives me both visual reference AND structured requirements I can implement systematically.
